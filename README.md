# Covid-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Using Deep Learning Models (transfer learning) to classify images as either COVID-19 positive, healthy, viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia.
The dataset includes a total of 18101 images, with 9201 images of patients suffering from Pneumonia(Including both Viral and Bacterial), 2423 of COVID-19 positive patients and 6477 images of Healthy(labelled "Normal") patients. 
The code for this project was built on top of Krish Naik's code, and the repository can be found here: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Transfer-Learning.
